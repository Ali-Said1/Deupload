                    <p class="feature-desc">At Deupload, we store your content on our custom-built Elastic IPFS instance, which ensures reliability and high performance to accommodate the scale of uploads we handle. Elastic IPFS guarantees continuous and speedy availability of your data over the IPFS network once it is uploaded. <br><br><br>

                        Before uploading, your data undergoes a local conversion process into a CAR (Content Addressable Archive) file, which transforms it into a format compatible with IPFS, represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). This powerful process generates a content address locally for your data, providing a fingerprint guarantee. Additionally, you can structure the DAG in meaningful ways, such as assigning individual content addresses to files within your folders or key-value pairs within your JSON data.</p>
